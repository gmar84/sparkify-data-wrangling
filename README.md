### Data Modeling with Postgres

---

### Project Description
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### Steps

Create the fact table and dimension tables in the form of a star schema
Design an ETL pipeline that extracts the data from the files and loads into the tables
 
### Song Data

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example:

    data/song_data/A/B/C/TRABCRU128F423F449.json

Here is what the above json file looks like:

    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "AR8IEZO1187B99055E", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Marc Shaiman", "song_id": "SOINLJW12A8C13314C", "title": "City Slickers", "duration": 149.86404, "year": 2008}
    
### Log Data

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example:

    data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-04-events.json

Which looks like this:

### Database schema
We are using the star schema for the design of the database

Fact table `songplays`
Four dimension tables `users`, `artists`, `time`, `songs`

Here is an Entity Relationship Diagram which depicts the star schema model:

### ETL pipeline
The ETL pipeline consists of two main functions that are implemented in `etl.py`

`process_song_file()`

The song file is extracted and transferred to the database

`process_log_file()`

The log file is extracted and transferred to the database

### How to run the scripts
1. First run the below script to create the tables:

`create_tables.py`

2. Then, to run the ETL-Pipeline, run the following script:

`etl.py`
